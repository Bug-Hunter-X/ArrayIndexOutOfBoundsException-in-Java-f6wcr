# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug.java file contains code that causes this error.  The bugSolution.java file provides a corrected version.
The error occurs because of off-by-one error in the loop index. The loop iterates one time too many, attempting to access an index that doesn't exist in the array.
This example is useful for understanding how to avoid such runtime exceptions and for practicing debugging skills in Java.
